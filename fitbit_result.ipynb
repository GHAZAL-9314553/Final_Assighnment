    "Ubiquitous self-tracking technologies have penetrated various aspects of our lives, from physical and mental health monitoring to fitness and entertainment. Yet, limited data exist on the association between in the wild large-scale physical activity patterns, sleep, stress, and overall health, and behavioral patterns and psychological measurements due to challenges in collecting and releasing such datasets,Despite limited data, this project will concentrate on exploring the relationship between fitness and two important aspects of health - sleep time and calorie expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is: Is there a meaningful relationship between the steps taken and distance tracked, and the time spent sleeping and being in bed? In order to answer this question, we will be examining the correlation between the steps taken, distance tracked, and time spent sleeping and in bed. This will give us an understanding of how closely these variables are related, and if there is a significant relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question is: Is the number of calories burned related to the distance traveled or the number of steps taken? This question is important because it will help us determine which of these two variables has a greater impact on caloric burn. By examining the correlation between the number of calories burned and the number of steps taken or the distance traveled, we can gain a better understanding of the relationship between these variables and the impact they have on caloric burn.\n",

This information will help us make informed decisions about how to optimize our fitness routine to improve our overall health and well-being.\n",

    "my second assumption :\" Based on my knowledge, it is plausible that there could be a negative relationship between the number of steps taken and the total distance with the TotalHoursAsleep and TotalTimeInBed . It is possible that individuals who take more steps and cover greater distances throughout the day may be more physically active and may have more difficulty falling or staying asleep at night due to higher levels of energy or discomfort. Conversely, individuals who take fewer steps and cover less distance may be less physically active and may experience less difficulty falling or staying asleep at night. However, it is important to note that this assumption may not hold true for every individual, as there are many factors that can affect sleep quality and duration. Additional research and data analysis would be necessary to confirm or refute this assumption\""
